STEP 1 -- Read Spiral Image file
input image filename: S6.png

y: data1.shape[0] = 1414
x: data1.shape[1] = 1498
   data1.shape[2] = 3

y: data.shape[0] = 1414
x: data.shape[1] = 1498
   data.shape[2] = 3


STEP 2 -- Determine the equation of the spiral by fitting to image data
--- Select the center by clicking on it ---

2: 683.7410827020201, 776.1931715695921

--- Select two points (one in zone 1 and the other in zone 2) on the spiral by clicking on the points ---
1: 601.8740488586305, 625.6838205847017
2: 870.8568281938327, 1288.0286343612336

STEP 3 -- Use the spiral equation ot flatten the Spiral Image

... It will take about 40 sec. (in Python 3.11) for the next window to appear ...
--- Select the end-point of the longest flattened spiral in the image ---
1: 2860.833600320384, 888.0519766577036
max_x_pixels: 2860

--- Select two points on the graph to define a rectangle. Only data inside this rectangle will be kept ---
1: 844.1278391212309, 983.8812575090108
2: 2903.7422335373867, 766.4775158761943

STEP 4 -- Crop to include pixels of a single stitched patientâ€™s hand-drawing
current_max_x_pixels: 2903
offset_x_pixels: 844

--- Select two points on the graph to define a rectangle. Picture data inside this rectangle will be converted to a discrete signal. ... ---
1: 341.875960061444, 211.64582181259607
2: 2009.4761904761908, 8.434224270353297

STEP 5 -- Derive the discrete signal and save it to Pandas data frames
