STEP 1 -- Read Discrete Signal and apply LP Filter
input_filename = S3_flattened_disc_signal
log_filename = S3_flattened_disc_signal_fft_log

Spatial Sampling Rate: 1 sample/pixel
Spatial Nyquest freq: 0.5 samples/pixel
Spatial cutoff freq: 0.2 samples/pixel
Spatial_cutoff_freq/spatial_nyquest_freq: 0.4

Signal rms before normalization: 20.03 pixel values

STEP 2 -- Determine FFT
Number of sample points: N = 2000
Number of coefficients in the transform, N/2 + 1: 1001

Time it took the patient to draw the whole spiral: 11.70 sec
Time it took the patient to draw the cropped part of the spiral: 9.96 sec
Sampling Rate: 200.85 Hz
Nyquest Frequency: 100.43 Hz
Low pass filter cutoff in Hz: 40.17 Hz

Number of coefficients in the LP band: 400

STEP 3 -- Truncate FFT and calculate Trunction Error
Number of coefficients in the transform after truncation: 150
Truncation Error: 10.89%

STEP 4 -- Save Coefficients
Truncated spectrum has been saved as S3_flattened_disc_signal_trunc_spectrum.csv
Transpose of truncated spectrum as features has been saved as S3_flattened_disc_signal_trunc_spectrum_feaatures.csv
