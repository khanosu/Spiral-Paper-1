STEP 1 -- Read Discrete Signal and apply LP Filter
input_filename = S2_disc_signal
log_filename = S2_disc_signal_fft_log

Spatial Sampling Rate: 1 sample/pixel
Spatial Nyquest freq: 0.5 samples/pixel
Spatial cutoff freq: 0.2 samples/pixel
Spatial_cutoff_freq/spatial_nyquest_freq: 0.4

Signal rms before normalization: 35.23 pixel values

STEP 2 -- Determine FFT
Number of sample points: N = 1000
Number of coefficients in the transform, N/2 + 1: 501

Time it took the patient to draw the whole spiral: 11.70 sec
Time it took the patient to draw the cropped part of the spiral: 10.93 sec
Sampling Rate: 91.48 Hz
Nyquest Frequency: 45.74 Hz
Low pass filter cutoff in Hz: 18.30 Hz

Number of coefficients in the LP band: 200

STEP 3 -- Truncate FFT and calculate Trunction Error
Number of coefficients in the transform after truncation: 150
Truncation Error: 3.88%

STEP 4 -- Save Coefficients
Truncated spectrum has been saved as S2_disc_signal_trunc_spectrum.csv
Transpose of truncated spectrum as features has been saved as S2_disc_signal_trunc_spectrum_feaatures.csv
