STEP 1 -- Read Discrete Signal and apply LP Filter
input_filename = S6_disc_signal
log_filename = S6_disc_signal_fft_log

Spatial Sampling Rate: 1 sample/pixel
Spatial Nyquest freq: 0.5 samples/pixel
Spatial cutoff freq: 0.2 samples/pixel
Spatial_cutoff_freq/spatial_nyquest_freq: 0.4

Signal rms before normalization: 35.27 pixel values

STEP 2 -- Determine FFT
Number of sample points: N = 1000
Number of coefficients in the transform, N/2 + 1: 501

Time it took the patient to draw the whole spiral: 11.70 sec
Time it took the patient to draw the cropped part of the spiral: 9.63 sec
Sampling Rate: 103.80 Hz
Nyquest Frequency: 51.90 Hz
Low pass filter cutoff in Hz: 20.76 Hz

Number of coefficients in the LP band: 200

STEP 3 -- Truncate FFT and calculate Trunction Error
Number of coefficients in the transform after truncation: 150
Truncation Error: 12.46%

STEP 4 -- Save Coefficients
Truncated spectrum has been saved as S6_disc_signal_trunc_spectrum.csv
Transpose of truncated spectrum as features has been saved as S6_disc_signal_trunc_spectrum_feaatures.csv
